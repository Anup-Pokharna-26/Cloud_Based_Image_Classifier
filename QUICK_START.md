# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Using Production Model (Recommended)
Your Google Drive model is already configured and will be downloaded automatically:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Option 2: Using Development/Testing Setup
If you want to test with a dummy model first:

```bash
python setup_dev.py
python app.py
```

## Access the Application

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: `http://localhost:8080`
3. Upload an image of Indian food
4. Select prediction method:
   - **Standard**: Basic prediction
   - **Enhanced**: Ensemble methods for better accuracy
   - **Smart**: Advanced preprocessing with highest accuracy
5. Click "Classify Image"

## Testing Everything Works

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_all_features.py
```

This will check:
- ‚úÖ All dependencies installed correctly
- ‚úÖ Model downloads from Google Drive
- ‚úÖ Model loads and runs predictions
- ‚úÖ All advanced features work
- ‚úÖ Web interface is ready

```

### If model download fails
Check your Google Drive URLs in `download_model.py` are public and correct.

### If dependencies are missing
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Ready for Production
